<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

<p align="left">My name is Samuel, Iâ€™m 29 years old, and my journey in programming started early, driven by curiosity and the desire to understand how things work behind the screen. I wrote my first lines of code at the age of 12, and I've been working professionally in the field since I was 19.<br><br>I primarily work with PHP (yes, PHP is great, but not everyone is ready for that conversation ðŸ˜„) and JavaScript. I have a degree in Systems Analysis and Development, and besides programming, Iâ€™m also comfortable working with infrastructure, virtualization, VM provisioning with Proxmox, Nginx, and all the other headaches that come with managing servers.<br><br>I have hands-on experience with MySQL, Redis, and WebSocket â€” technologies I frequently use to build real-time, scalable, and well-optimized applications.<br><br>More recently, I started diving into LUA to extend Nginx capabilities in a more flexible (and budget-friendly) way â€” because paying for the enterprise version isn't always an option, and CDNs donâ€™t always solve everything.<br><br>Here, youâ€™ll find a bit of what Iâ€™m building, learning, and sharing. Welcome to my profile! ðŸš€</p>
